Version 0.9.1a
-------------
Made it work with Mattermost

Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Fix slack @mentions not linking correctly
  - Note: It still doesn't work with app webhooks, potentially due to a slack bug
* Only show slack buttons if SLACK_INTERACTIVE_MESSAGES is set to true
  - Some custom config is required on slacks end, so doesn't make sense to show it by default


Version 0.8.0
-------------

* Add slack acknowledge button and callback

Version 0.7.0
-------------

* Add migrations to work with Cabot >=0.7
